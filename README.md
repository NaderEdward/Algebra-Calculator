# Equation Solver

An algorithm that takes a str equation and works out the value of a variable. In mode 1, it finds the value of a variable. In mode 2, it finds 2 values for the variable in a quadratic equation.

## Modes
### Mode 1:
After entering "1" in the mode input form. The calculator requires a linear equation containing one variable not in parentheses and at the end of the expression (it would be the last term before/after the "=")/. The calculator prints the value of the varible. Erros will be raised if a divison by 0 is present or if a negative square root is computed.
### Mode 2:
After entering "2" in the mode input form. The calculator requires a quadratic equation in the form "ax^2 + bx + c = 0" (it musn't equal 0, the calculator aranges the expression to make it equal 0).
The calculator prints all possible values of the varible. Erros will be raised if a divison by 0 is present or if a negative square root is computed.
